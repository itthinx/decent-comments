Decent Comments shows what people say. A more engaging way to show comments.

== Description ==

__Decent Comments shows what people say.__

The Decent Comments plugin helps you show comments on your site in a neat way. It lets you display comments along with avatars of the people who wrote them and previews of what they said. This makes your site more engaging for visitors.

If you want to show comments along with their author's avatars _and_ an excerpt of their comment, recent comments on any of your posts, posts from certain categories and other criteria ... then this might just be the right plugin for you.

The plugin provides configurable blocks, widgets, shortcodes and an API to display comments in sensible ways. This includes author avatars, links, comment excerpts ...

Anywhere you place comments, by means of its block, widget, shortcode or by using its API, you can:

- Show an excerpt or the full comment. You can choose to not show the comment as well.
- Determine the number of words shown for excerpts.
- Set your kind of ellipsis.
- Set the number of comments to show.
- Show the author's avatar and determine its size.
- Sort by author email, author URL, content (what's said in the comment), date, karma or post ... in ascending or descending order.
- Show comments for the current post or for a specific post.
- Show comments for a specific post type.
- Show comments for posts in specific categories, for specific tags, ... (more precisely: the ability to show comments from posts related to one or more terms in a chosen taxonomy).
- Show comments for a set of posts and/or excluding a set of posts.
- and more to come ... got suggestions?
