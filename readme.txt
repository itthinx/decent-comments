== Description ==

__Decent Comments shows what people say.__

If you want to show comments along with their author's avatars _and_ an excerpt of their comment, then this is the right plugin for you.

And it's not limited to just a widget showing recent comments: The plugin provides configurable widgets, shortcodes and an API to display comments in sensible ways, including author avatars, links, comment excerpts ...

Anywhere you place comments, by means of a widget, a shortcode or an API call, you can:

- Show an excerpt or the full comment. You can choose to not show the comment as well.
- Determine the number of words shown for excerpts.
- Set your kind of ellipsis.
- Set the number of comments to show.
- Show the author's avatar and determine it's size.
- Sort by author email, author URL, content (what's said in the comment), date, karma or post ... in ascending or descending order.
- Show comments for the current post or for a specific post.
- Show comments for a specific post type.
- Show comments for posts in specific categories, for specific tags, ... (more precisely: the ability to show comments from posts related to one or more terms in a chosen taxonomy).
- and more to come ... got suggestions?
